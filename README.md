# Description
~~~
In The Cube is a platform/puzzle game.

Indeed, you will have to solve a multitude of challenges. Your agility and
reflection vill be put to the test.

The key to saving the world lies in a 1cm long cube, which is why an even
smaller cube that you will embody is sent inside.

Through more than thirty levels, you will discover a multitude of mechanisms
(laser, mirrors,…). Manipulate them with talent to go through the cube.

Strange machines are found in the most advanced levels.
~~~

This game use the [SMK library](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/smk) made by
the same author of this game.

Disclaimer:
~~~
This game was originaly made 8 years ago in 2011. Then I converted
it to WebAssembly. Even if it has been hugely refactored this year, its code is
still a bit "low quality".
